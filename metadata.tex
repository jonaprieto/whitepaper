\newcommand{\pubabstract}{%
Programmable settlement architectures do not enable counterparty discovery
and solving, both of which are necessary to build the majority of
interactive multi-party applications. The architectural constraints of
programmable settlement result in contemporary application protocols that
have at least one Web2 component, which becomes the centralisation point.
We present Anoma, a unified architecture for full-stack decentralised
applications. Anoma is designed following the principles of
intent-centricity and homogeneous architecture / heterogeneous security,
together constituting a declarative paradigm for building decentralised
applications. In this paper, we first outline the Anoma architecture,
provide an intuition for the design rationale, and describe how Anoma
disentangles the choices of protocol and security. We then define the Anoma
application programming model and enumerate several existing and novel
decentralised applications that can be built using the novel primitives.
Finally, we outline the current components used to instantiate Anoma and
list future research directions.
